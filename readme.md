Spica is not a framework, it's a full-fledged free and open-source development engine. We aim cost-efficient, fast and reliable development. Spica fulfills the needs of development such as:

* Data modeling with Bucket Architecture.
* Custom behavior implementation.
* Policy-based identity management system.
* Platform agnostic build with API-first approach
* And many more...

### Spica is free and always will be! :v:
