## User Activity Logs

User Activity module gives you access to control each passport identities' activity logs. You can filter actrivity logs by identity, action type, module, date or even document id. In a standart build of Spica, you can see all user activies without any time limitation.

> IMPORTANT: Because of no time limit on user acitivity logs, we suggest you to clear user activities in a time interval. Otherwise you should consider your server hardwares to use Spica instance with hight performance.

To list all Spica users' activity, simply navigate to **Primary** -> **User Activities**
