# Getting Started

This tutorial helps you to install Spica to different environments.
First, we will explain a few things as Spica has few requirements to work.

## Table of contents

## Requirements

- **mongoDB** 4.2-rc and above
- **nodeJS** 10 and above

As spica relies on **replica set** feature of MongoDB, you need to configure at least **3 members** of a replica set.

> Important: One of the replica set members must have _slaveDelay_ enabled and delay time must be greater than 3 seconds. (5 seconds suggested.)

## Installation

As we are publishing Spica as container images, you need a container runtime to use official Spica images.

> Note: If you are not familiar with containers, we highly recommend you to get familiar with them.

### CLI

Spica has a command-line interface for quick and fast spica installation. You can use it for fast local development or if you want to opt-in quickly. To use CLI, you must have Docker and NodeJs installed on your computer.

#### Install

Before you go, ensure that the Docker and NodeJs correctly installed on your computer by running the following commands:

- Ensure that the Docker installed correctly

```sh
$ docker ps
# The docker command above will show an empty list if you installed Docker for the first time.
```

- Ensure that the NodeJs installed correctly

```sh
$ npm --v
# When you install NodeJs, it will come with a built-in package manager
# so when you run the above command you will see the version of the npm.
```

To install CLI run following command in your computer.

```sh
$ npm install @spicaengine/cli -g
# This command will install CLI globally on your computer.
```

```sh
# Hint: You can use other package managers as well.
# Yarn (yarnpkg.com)
$ yarn global add @spicaengine/cli
# PNPM (pnpm.js.org)
$ pnpm install @spicaengine/cli -g
```

#### Creating your first Spica instance with CLI.

Spica CLI has a command for creating Spica instances on your computer. This command will pull all necessary images and create desired spica containers on your Docker.

To create an instance on your computer simply run:

```sh
$ spica run my-first-spica-instance # You can use a different name
# This command will create a Spica instance named as run my-first-spica-instance on 4500 port
# if that port is not in use however if the port 4500(default port) in use, CLI will another port that is not in use.
```

> HINT: If you want to use a custom port you can use --port option like below

```sh
$ spica run my-first-spica-instance --port=80
# NOTE: If the port 80 is in use, CLI will go on and find another port that is not in use.
```

When everything completed, you will get an output similar to below:

```console
✔ Pulling images (4/4)
✔ Creating a network named test-network.
✔ Creating database containers (3/3)
✔ Initiating replication between database containers.
✔ Waiting for the replica set to become ready.
✔ Creating spica containers (2/2)
✔ Creating an ingress to route traffic.
Spica my-first-spica-instance is serving on http://localhost:4500
Open your browser on http://localhost:4500/spica to login.
```

### Kubernetes

- Install kubectl: https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/
- After you'll need a kubernetes environment it can be either a local or a cloud kubernetes environment.
- For local Kubernetes, you can use minikube: https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-minikube/
- For AWS, you can create an EKS cluster: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/create-cluster.html
- For GCP, you can create a GKE cluster: https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/creating-a-cluster
- For Azure, you can create an AKS cluster: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/kubernetes-walkthrough
- Ensure kubectl connected to the kubernetes cluster by running `kubectl get nodes` command.
- The Cluster must have Nginx ingress controller enabled. You can follow https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/deploy/ to install Nginx ingress on the cluster.
- Just apply `kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spica-engine/spica/master/deployment.yaml`

### Docker

- Install docker on your environment and ensure that you have installed docker correctly by running "`docker ps`" command.
- For macOS: https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/
- For Windows: https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/
- For other platforms checkout docker webpage: https://docs.docker.com
- Create a docker network for communication between Spica services.

```sh
docker network create spica
```

- Setup **Three Replica Set** MongoDB

```sh
docker run --name mongo-1 --network spica -d mongo --replSet "rs0" --bind_ip_all
docker run --name mongo-2 --network spica -d mongo --replSet "rs0" --bind_ip_all
docker run --name mongo-3 --network spica -d mongo --replSet "rs0" --bind_ip_all
```

- Ensure that all three of replica set members are up and running.

```sh
# Run the command below
docker ps --filter=Name=mongo
# If you get an output that similar to this, that means you are good to go.
CONTAINER ID IMAGE COMMAND CREATED STATUS PORTS NAMES
9183a4935e2d mongo "docker-entrypoint.s…" 10 minutes ago Up 10 minutes 27017/tcp mongo-3
34920d7d9124 mongo "docker-entrypoint.s…" 10 minutes ago Up 10 minutes 27017/tcp mongo-2
e73c9107d53d mongo "docker-entrypoint.s…" 10 minutes ago Up 10 minutes 27017/tcp mongo-1
```

- Setup replication between members so they can elect a primary.

```sh
docker exec -it mongo-1 mongo admin --eval 'rs.initiate({
 _id: "rs0",
 members: [
 { _id: 0, host : "mongo-1" },
 { _id: 1, host : "mongo-2" },
 { _id: 2, host : "mongo-3", priority : 0, slaveDelay: 5, tags: { slaveDelay: "true" } }
 ]
})'
```

- Additionally, if you want to keep your files on every container update, you need to mount a docker volume to your **`api`** container and change `PERSISTENT_PATH` environment variable. For more info checkout: https://docs.docker.com/storage/volumes/
- Setup spica

```sh
# Start spica (client) on port 8080
docker run --name spica --network spica -p 8080:80 -d gcr.io/spica-239113/spica
# Start spica (api) on port 4300
docker run
 --name api
 --network spica
 -p 4300:4300
 -e PORT=4300
 -e DATABASE_URI="mongodb://mongo-1,mongo-2,mongo-3"
 -e REPLICA_SET="rs0"
 -e DATABASE_NAME=spica
 -e PUBLIC_HOST=http://localhost:4300 # You can replace this with your domain name if you have any.
 -e PERSISTENT_PATH=/tmp # The path that the storage files will be kept at.
 -d gcr.io/spica-239113/api
# Important: you need to apply these two commands until
# https://github.com/spica-engine/spica/issues/20 resolves.
docker exec -it spica sed -i "s/\/spica\//\//g" /usr/share/nginx/html/index.html
# Basically, this replaces /api with http://localhost:4300 which is our accesible api url.
docker exec -w /usr/share/nginx/html -it spica find . -type f -iname 'main-es*.js' -exec sed -i 's/\"\/api\"/\"http:\/\/localhost:4300\"/g' {} \;
```

- Ensure you have setup everything correctly

```sh
# Run
docker ps
# And you will see an output like this
CONTAINER ID IMAGE COMMAND CREATED STATUS PORTS NAMES
76211cf5d960 gcr.io/spica-239113/api "/app/stacks/api_ima…" 6 seconds ago Up 5 seconds 0.0.0.0:4300->4300/tcp api
66001a891855 gcr.io/spica-239113/spica "nginx -g 'daemon of…" 17 seconds ago Up 16 seconds 0.0.0.0:8080->80/tcp spica

a0ecdc3c6f68 mongo "docker-entrypoint.s…" 30 seconds ago Up 28 seconds 27017/tcp mongo-1
# the first container (api) is our api service, core of our spica instance.
# the second container (spica) is our client which communicates with api container.
# the other ones (mongo-1, mongo-2, mongo-3) is our three-member replica set mongodb containers.
```

- Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:8080
- The default `identifier` is `spica` and the password is `123`.
