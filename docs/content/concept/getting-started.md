# Getting Started

## Introduction

These documents will take you from zero to hero and helps you to discover advanced features of the Spica Development Engine.

### What is Spica?

Spica (a.k.a. Spica Development Engine) is an open-source package that gives virtually everything a backend developer needs. It gives a pre-built administration panel and a fully manageable no-code REST API. It can be used as a backend service, a database layer, or as a headless CMS for managing content.

### Differences Between Spica API and Spica Client

Spica Development Engine divided into two parts because of principal differences.

Spica Client, is a user-friendly admin panel for those who like to manage their development process from a panel with a few clicks.

Spica API, on the other hand, is a fully controllable REST API.

As Spica has an API-first approach, any features of the engine are controllable via HTTP calls. Also, itâ€™s suitable to integrate with any frontend application to free the product owners from backend development costs.
