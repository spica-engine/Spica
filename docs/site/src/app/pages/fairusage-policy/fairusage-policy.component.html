    <h3>Usage Policy</h3>
    <p>
      This Usage Policy is a key part of the agreement between you and Teknodev LTD (the managing
      entity of Managed Spica), which regulates your use of the Managed Spica service. If you do not
      agree with this Usage Policy, do not use any of Managed Spica services. The limits outlined
      below apply only to current plans. If the limits within your Enterprise Tier Service Agreement
      differ from those below, the Service Agreement supersedes.

    <p>
      The usage of API requests and the Asset bandwidth is measured on a calendar monthly basis.
      Usage is reset on the first day of each month. For example, if you signed up on the 15th, your
      usage period is set to be from 15th to 1th of a calendar month. Additional API requests will
      be billed at $5 per 1,000,000 API requests (included internal function requests) per month.
      Additional asset bandwidth consumption will be billed at $25 per 250GB per month. The fees are
      applied after the initial metrics above are exceeded. All API requests are included in this
      metric, including those being sent when using the Admin App. Usage limits can only be exceeded
      if your organization has a valid payment method on file.

    <h3>Additional Users</h3>

    <p>
      Each project includes 5 free users, each additional user is $10 per month. Billing is based on
      the maximum number of users during the billing period. All users are included in the total
      count, regardless of their status (eg: Draft or Active).
    </p>

    <h3>Collection Overages</h3>
    <p>
      Each Directus Cloud tier has a different number of included collections, each additional
      collection is $5 per month. Billing is based on the maximum number of collections during the
      billing period. All non-system collections are included in the total count, including any
      junction/helper collections you create.
    </p>

    <h3>Item Overages</h3>
    <p>
      Each Directus Cloud tier has a different number of included items, additional items are billed
      at $5/1,000 items per month. Billing is based on the maximum number of items during the
      billing period. All non-system items are included in the total count, regardless of their
      status (eg: Draft or Active). This also includes soft-deleted items, so be aware of if you
      setup your collections to soft or hard delete.
    </p>

    <h3>Activity & Revisions</h3>
    <p>
      For accountability reasons, Directus tracks all system activity and item revisions within your
      project. These are currently flagged as "system items", and are not counted in your Items
      metric. However, we reserve the right to prune older or excessive activity/revision data as
      needed. In the future, we may track this data as a separate tier metric, or include it with
      the existing Items metric.
